# Project 1 - *Simple Todo*

**Simple Todo** is an Android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Emily Su**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **view a list of todo items**
* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [x] User's **list of items are persisted** across app restarts

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [x] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected back in the todo list

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Every todo item has a different color (any time a todo item is added, edited, or when the app restarts, the color of the todo item changes)

## Notes
Learned:
- What CRUD and MVC are and how they are applied in this app
- How to use adapters, event listeners, and intents

Challenges:
- Formatting the Add button on the main page (edited margins to fix this error)
- Had difficulties with FileUtils from Android vs. from Apache Commons
